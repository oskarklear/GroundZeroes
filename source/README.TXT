Project: Operation Ground Zeroes

Authors: Oskar Klear, Michael Kölling, and David J. Barnes

Version: 20.11.17

This is Operation Ground Zeroes, an action-packed stealth espionage game!

The objective of this game is to extract a captured agent by avoiding detection and not dying.

You complete the mission if you successfully extract the target, but will lose if you are detected or die.

The game is set in Cuba in 1975, on a U.S military black site used to detain people, mostly for interrogation.

Watch your step as you navigate the camp, these marines mean business.

To locate the target, you can interrogate guards or use your wits to locate him on your own.

You'll need a key to unlock the cell, which is located somewhere in the camp.

Various items are scattered around the map that may prove beneficial, so keep an eye out.



Good luck, Boss.


Ground Zeroes is a tactical action text-based game, where the user moves from room to room, gathers items, and interacts with guards in order to complete an objective. 
The game features 18 unique rooms and several different items for the user to interact with, each of which has a special ability. 
Certain rooms also have guards within them that move after the user moves to a new room. The user can interact with guards in several ways, including using different items on him, interrogating him, or simply sneaking past him.
This game also has a secret room that teleports the user to a random room. 
The game also features several execution interruptions, which is used for animations as well as added effect when searching a room or interrogations.
When the objective is complete, the game will give you a ranking based on how many moves the user does (or how many times a user goes to a new room).




KNOWN BUGS
___________________

-On occasion the game will not tell a user if a guard is in a room until the user tries to move. Changes have been made and I have not seen it since,
but the problem could still be present. Bug has occurred in the spawn location and after using the teleporter room.
